# Airflow for MLOps 🚀

Welcome to the **Airflow for MLOps** project! This repository documents my journey as I explore **Apache Airflow** and its role in building robust, scalable, and maintainable Machine Learning (ML) pipelines.

Whether you're just starting with MLOps or looking to integrate Airflow into your workflow, this repo will grow into a hands-on guide packed with examples, DAGs, and insights.

---

## 📌 Project Goals

* ✅ Understand Apache Airflow fundamentals
* ✅ Build ML pipelines as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)
* ✅ Integrate data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and deployment steps
* ✅ Automate ML workflows for reliability and reproducibility
* ✅ Learn how Airflow fits into a modern MLOps stack

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Apache Airflow** (core orchestration engine)
* **Python** (ML & DAG scripting)
* **Docker** (containerized development)
* **Pandas / Scikit-learn** (ML experimentation)
* **Postgres** (Airflow metadata DB)
* Optional: **MLflow**, **S3/GCS**, **Kubernetes** in later stages
